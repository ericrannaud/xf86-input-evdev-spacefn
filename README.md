This is modified from Ljosa's work: instead of emitting the MENU keycode
when Space is held, emit LVL3.

To install:
- Follow build instructions at
  http://www.ljosa.com/~ljosa/software/spacefn-xorg/
- Copy 10-evdev.conf to /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/ to make sure the `evdev` driver
  instead of `libinput` by Xorg.

This fork provides an implementation of SpaceFn in xf86-input-evdev.

    "The SpaceFN layout: trying to end keyboard inflation"
    https://geekhack.org/index.php?topic=51069.0

The idea of SpaceFn is to let the space key work as both a regular
space and a modifier. For more information about the implementation
and how to build, install, and configure it, see
http://www.ljosa.com/~ljosa/software/spacefn-xorg/.
